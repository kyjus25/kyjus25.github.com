      <p>Thanks for checking out my portfolio! I am a web and software developer from Charleston, Illinois. I use the latest web technologies to deliver cutting-edge UI/UX experiences for both commercial and personal applications. In my free time I enjoy game development, honing my creative skills by building GitHub projects and helping on the Wordpress forums... and I also enjoy riding motorcycles.</p>
